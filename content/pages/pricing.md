      - title: How are usage fees determined?
        content: >
          Usage amounts, provided directly from Amazon Web Services,  for media
          stored (GBs), media converted (minutes) and media shares (GBS) are
          posted daily to your account.
      - title: What happens to my data when I cancel my account?
        content: >
          You can export all data in .csv format, and download any .mp4 file,
          while you have an active account.  Within 30 days after cancellation,
          Dadabase can transfer your master video files along with any .mp4
          files created through MediaConvert. You must pay for all costs
          associated with the transfer.  Please contact us for more
          information.  After 30 days, all data, including video files, will be
          deleted.
      - title: What happens if my credit card is declined
        content: >
          We will notify you that the card has been declined. All upload and
          sharing features will be suspended until you update your card
          information.  If the credit card is not updated within 2 weeks, we
          will suspend all access to your account.  You account will be
          cancelled if it the card is not updated within 30 days after it was
          first declined.  Then all data, including videos, will be deleted 30
          days after your account was cancelled.
      - title: Will I be charged multiple times during a month?
        content: >
          Upon account creation, you will be immediately charged a $20
          subscription fee. At the end of the period, you will be charged for
          any usage fees incurred during that period, along with a $20
          subscription fee for the subsequent period.  If the sum of all usage
          fees for the period exceeds $200 at any time, you will be immediately
          billed $200, and then billed again for the remainder of your invoice
          at the end of the month.  Please contact us if you would like to raise
          the $200 limit.
      - title: Do you offer discounts?
        content: >
          Sure! If you have a lot of content or if you have long-term needs,
          contact us and we can create a custom plan.
      - title: Can I have multiple projects?
        content: >
          Yes. You can have as many projects as you'd like. A separate monthly
          subscription is required for each project. Each project will be billed
          separately.
