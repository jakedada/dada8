      - title: Can I use multiple languages?
        content: |-
          App Land currently supports English, Spanish, German and French. Other
          languages are on the roadmap and should be rolled out by the end of
          the year.
      - title: Do you support native iPhone apps?
        content: |-
          Absolutely. Both native iOS and Android apps are supported and work
          seamlessly with App Land.
      - title: Will my tasks be marked as done on their platform?
        content: |-
          As soon as you complete a task, App Land updates your task lists on
          their respective platforms to make sure it's crossed-off immediately.
      - title: What if someone else completes my task?
        content: |-
          Once a task is complete, you will get a notification letting you know
          that you have one less thing to worry about - no matter who completes
          it!
      - title: Which integrations do you have?
        content: |-
          We work with all major productivity apps and platforms and support all
          native iOS and Android apps.
